#PiBakery-XML

Here you can find the xml-files for PiBakery.
Just load it into PiBakery and create the image.

After inserting the SD-Card into the Raspberry Pi, he will begin to install...

Pimatic_daemon_start - is for daemonized starting Pimatic
Pimatic_non-daemon_start - is for nondaemonized starting Pimatic
Adafruit-2,8Zoll-NewTronPi - was for my Raspberry Pi B+ and an Adafruit-2,8Zoll - TouchDisplay (maybe someone would help this)
